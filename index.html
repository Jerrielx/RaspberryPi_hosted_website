      <h3> Overview </h3>
      <p>This is my personal website and technical workspace.</p>

      <p>
        It is hosted on my own Raspberry Pi and built step by step as
        I learn more about Linux, frontend programming and networks.
        The site serves as a place to document projects, experiments and
        ongoing work. In addition to documentation,
        the website functions as a personal homepage and a simple portfolio of my work.
      </p>
