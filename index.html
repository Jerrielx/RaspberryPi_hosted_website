    <h1> Jerry Cheung</h1>
    <h2> Ingenjörsstudent i datateknik</h2>
    <p>This is my personal website and technical workspace.</p>

    <p>
      It is hosted on my own Raspberry Pi and built step by step as 
      I learn more about Linux, frontend programming and networks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The site serves as a place to document projects, experiments and 
      ongoing work. Some parts are finished, others are still under 
      development and may change over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to documentation, the website functions as a personal 
      homepage and a simple portfolio of my work.
    </p>

    <p>
      The content will continue to expand as new projects and features are added.
