This is my personal website and technical workspace.
It is hosted on my own Raspberry Pi and built step by step as I learn more about Linux, frontend programming and networks.
The site serves as a place to document projects, experiments and ongoing work. Some parts are finished, others are still under development and may change over time.
In addition to documentation, the website functions as a personal homepage and a simple portfolio of my work.
The content will continue to expand as new projects and features are added.
